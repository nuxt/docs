## New Features ‚ú®

### Speaking of TypeScript...

> TypeScript support has landed!

[![nuxt-ts](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k_PnuXll--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/51127667-51b2b180-1826-11e9-9e8f-07bb39d09d3a.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k_PnuXll--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/51127667-51b2b180-1826-11e9-9e8f-07bb39d09d3a.gif)

In order to run Nuxt with TypeScript, we created a new distribution, called [nuxt-ts](http://npmjs.com/package/nuxt-ts) (we also have [nuxt-ts-edge](http://npmjs.com/package/nuxt-ts-edge)).  
We want to thank [@hmsk](https://dev.to/hmsk) for his donation of the package name on npm ‚ù§Ô∏è

You can explore [Nuxt TypeScript example](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/tree/dev/examples/typescript) or play with it directly in our [Nuxt TS CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/nuxt/nuxt.js/tree/dev/examples/typescript).

For a more advanced example, you can look at the [HackerNews-TS repo](https://github.com/nuxt-community/hackernews-nuxt-ts) or play with it on [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/nuxt-community/hackernews-nuxt-ts), made by [@husayt](https://dev.to/husayt) & [@kevinmarrec](https://dev.to/kevinmarrec) .

This work has been made by [@kevinmarrec](https://dev.to/kevinmarrec) with the help of [@pi0](https://dev.to/pi0) & [@atinux](https://dev.to/atinux) .

‚ö†Ô∏è **Experimental:** We are waiting for your feedback to keep improving it and breaking changes can occur without a semver major release. However, all changes will be documented properly

### Smart prefetching ‚ö°Ô∏è

Nuxt.js will automagically prefetch the code-splitted pages linked with `<nuxt-link>` when visible in the viewport **by default**. This hugely improves the end user performances, inspired by [quicklink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/quicklink).

[![nuxt-prefetch-comparison](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jP7Crsw7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/51692960-4158be80-1ffe-11e9-9299-61881d06412e.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jP7Crsw7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/51692960-4158be80-1ffe-11e9-9299-61881d06412e.gif)

Demos are online and we recommend you to try it out to feel the difference:

*   No prefetching (v2.3): [https://nuxt-no-prefetch.surge.sh](https://nuxt-no-prefetch.surge.sh)
*   With prefetching (v2.4): [https://nuxt-prefetch.surge.sh](https://nuxt-prefetch.surge.sh)

**Bonus:** we added `$nuxt.isOnline` and `$nuxt.isOffline` which is reactive, so you can use it directly inside your components (see [this example](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/blob/dev/examples/nuxt-prefetch/layouts/default.vue#L3)).

You can learn more about this feature in the associated PR #4574 and in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/api/components-nuxt-link).

### HMR & best practices for `store/` üëÄ

> Save more development time with full HMR support for the store (`mutations`, `getters`, and `actions`).

[![nuxt-vuex-hmr](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oq49NDCr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/51385153-b3bd3080-1b1e-11e9-891f-c136a3182ca0.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oq49NDCr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/51385153-b3bd3080-1b1e-11e9-891f-c136a3182ca0.gif)

This feature has been implemented by [@mannil](https://dev.to/mannil) & [@atinux](https://dev.to/atinux) on PRs #4589, #4582 and #4791

### Autocomplete for VS Code (via. Vetur extension) ‚úÖ

If you are using VS Code, with this version, you will now have autocomplete for Nuxt.js components:

[![nuxt-vs-autocomplete](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OC6YX46I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/51854163-70d33800-232a-11e9-98b0-f5e7406996cd.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OC6YX46I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/51854163-70d33800-232a-11e9-98b0-f5e7406996cd.gif)

This feature has been implemented by [@octref](https://dev.to/octref) & [@atinux](https://dev.to/atinux) on PR #4524

### Port taken? Nuxt got your back! üí™

If Nuxt wants to listen on a port which is already used, it will warn you **in development** and listen to a free port instead:

[![49249621-efe2e780-f431-11e8-90fb-ba48e67ba5c9](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ooxDU4_W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/49298719-5c0b2d00-f4be-11e8-9639-ec914ff64782.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ooxDU4_W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/49298719-5c0b2d00-f4be-11e8-9639-ec914ff64782.png)

In production it will throw an error instead to avoid unwanted behavior:

[![49249634-f8d3b900-f431-11e8-9f51-afbf3ffc68ed](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1yqZBa_v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/49298757-6e856680-f4be-11e8-9485-812805b83906.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1yqZBa_v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/49298757-6e856680-f4be-11e8-9485-812805b83906.png)

This feature has been implemented by [@ricardogobbosouza](https://dev.to/ricardogobbosouza) on PR #4428 with the help of [@pi0](https://dev.to/pi0) and [@mannil](https://dev.to/mannil) .

### Suggest installing missing dependencies or mismatches üíØ

Nuxt requires all peer like dependencies as a dependency for easier usage. Sometimes this causes unwanted behaviors when users explicitly add a specific version in their package.json which is incompatible with nuxt. This could also help to resolve popular Vue packages version mismatch error (#198, #669, #1084, #1414, #1851, #2079, #2406, #3454).

Nuxt is now able to automatically self-verify installed dependencies and warn with a proper message in case of detecting problems.

[![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--x7Y9f4Oe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5158436/50593651-613d0c80-0eae-11e9-89b4-396c5f64d31d.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--x7Y9f4Oe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5158436/50593651-613d0c80-0eae-11e9-89b4-396c5f64d31d.png)

This feature has been implemented by [@pi0](https://dev.to/pi0) in PR [#4669](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/pull/4669)

### Auto-detection of modern bundles ü•á

When running `nuxt start`, Nuxt will automatically detect if you built your app modern mode enabled. No need to run `nuxt start --modern`explicitly anymore üåü

[![screenshot 2018-11-30 at 16 55 48](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gocbhrVn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/49299896-1bf97980-f4c1-11e8-9321-9268c0f4c228.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gocbhrVn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/49299896-1bf97980-f4c1-11e8-9321-9268c0f4c228.png)

This detection was created by [@clarkdo](https://dev.to/clarkdo) on PR [#4422](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/pull/4422)

### Plugin modes and file extensions üíÖ

Until now, you used `ssr: false` in your plugin declarations to disable server-side rendering. We decided to deprecate that option and introduce a `mode` instead, which can be `'all'`, `'client'` or `'server'`. No worries, `ssr` is still working (until Nuxt 3).

The new feature coming with the `mode` is that you can define it by using the file suffix:

*   `plugins/plugin.server.js`
*   `plugins/plugin.client.js`
*   `plugins/plugin.js`

By adding the plugins to your `nuxt.config.js`:  

<div class="highlight">

    plugins: [
      '~/plugins/plugin.server.js',
      '~/plugins/plugin.client.js',
      '~/plugins/plugin.js'
    ]

</div>

The declaration will be internally transformed to:  

<div class="highlight">

    plugins: [
      { mode: 'server', src: '~/plugins/plugin.server.js' },
      { mode: 'client', src: '~/plugins/plugin.client.js' },
      { mode: 'all', src: '~/plugins/plugin.js' }
    ]

</div>

(If you specify the `mode` manually, it will overwrite the suffix detection)

This feature has been implemented by [@clarkdo](https://dev.to/clarkdo) on PR [#4592](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/pull/4592)

### Module commands üñ•

Nuxt modules can now include `bin` scripts that are recognized by Nuxt's CLI.

Here's an example of `my-module/bin/command.js`:  

<div class="highlight">

    #!/usr/bin/env node

    const consola = require('consola')
    const { NuxtCommand } = require('@nuxt/cli')

    NuxtCommand.run({
      name: 'command',
      description: 'My Module Command',
      usage: 'command <foobar>',
      options: {
        foobar: {
          alias: 'fb',
          type: 'string',
          description: 'Simple test string'
        }
      },
      run(cmd) {
        consola.info(cmd.argv)
      }
    })

</div>

The command could be run with:  

<div class="highlight">

    npx nuxt command arg1 arg2

</div>

You can learn more about that in the [modules command documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/modules#module-package-commands).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Experimental:** We are waiting for your feedback to keep improving it and breaking changes can occur without a semver major release. However, all changes will be documented properly <3

This feature has been implemented by [@galvez](https://dev.to/galvez) on PR #4314 with the help of [@pi0](https://dev.to/pi0) .

### PostCSS in Vue Components üíÉ

You can now use `lang="postcss"` in your Vue components. Postcss has applied to _all_ your styles anyway (e.g. to resolve aliases like `~`) but the `lang` attribute enables autocomplete and syntax highlighting for some IDEs.

[![nuxt-postcss](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J-ePlYh9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/49299286-ad67ec00-f4bf-11e8-9a4d-96e725e1fcf9.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J-ePlYh9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/49299286-ad67ec00-f4bf-11e8-9a4d-96e725e1fcf9.png)

This feature has been implemented by [@mannil](https://dev.to/mannil) on PR #4417.

### No more extensions for Stylesheets needed ü¶Ö

[![stylesheet extensions](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EN8qtaNn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/640208/51384714-05f95400-1b15-11e9-9ff4-d05451c9d548.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EN8qtaNn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/640208/51384714-05f95400-1b15-11e9-9ff4-d05451c9d548.gif)

We are concerned to improve the Developer Experience ("DX") with each release. This small change allows you to omit the file extension for CSS/SCSS/Postcss/Less/Stylus/... files listed in the `css` array inside your `nuxt.config.js`. For the `plugins` or `serverMiddleware` key, this is already possible.

This feature has been implemented by [@mannil](https://dev.to/mannil) on PR [#4671](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/pull/4671).

### SSR Bundle improvements üîπ

We made a full rewrite of how SSR bundle is packaged.

This means better performance, less memory overhead, fewer OOM crashes and easier SSR bundle debugging.

### Upgrade Note ‚ö†Ô∏è

Due to a known problem (webpack/webpack#8656, #4869, #4839) users of **npm** should either remove `package-lock.json` and reinstall before upgrade or use `npm update acorn --depth 20 && npm dedupe` after upgrading to 2.4.0\. **yarn** users should have no problems but removing `yarn.lock` still recommended before the upgrade process.
