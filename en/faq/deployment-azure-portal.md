# How to deploy on Azure Portal

If you are using Azure DevOps and let the build pipeline do its work you and want to store artifacts. Files
which are prefixed with a `.` must be moved to the artifact folder explicitly. Then you can create an Artifact Archive and 
download it afterwards in your Release Deployment. 

## Running the webserver
For Azure Portal you will need a `web.config` file. If not supplied, it will create one itself. This one **won't work for Nuxt** though.
Add a web.config file to your repository. For the latest version of `Nuxt` the server file is located at `server/index.js`. 
In the web.config you don't specify the exact path `server/index.js` but just `server`. See the example web.config below. If you don't do
this the logs will tell you that Vue cannot find any routes.

      You can control how Node is hosted within IIS using the following options:
        * watchedFiles: semi-colon separated list of files that will be watched for changes to restart the server
        * node_env: will be propagated to node as NODE_ENV environment variable
        * debuggingEnabled - controls whether the built-in debugger is enabled
