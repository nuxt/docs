Static Site Generation is a very hot topic right now! Instead of switching to another framework and
spending time to get used to it, why not killing two birds with one stone?

Nuxt.js supports generating a static website based on your Vue application. It is the "best of both worlds"
as you don't need a server but still have SEO benefits because Nuxt will pre-render all pages and include
the necessary HTML. Also, you can deploy the resulting page easily to Netlify or GitHub pages.
