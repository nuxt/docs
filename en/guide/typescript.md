title: TypeScript Support
---

> A static type system can help prevent many potential runtime errors, especially as applications grow.
>
> That's why Nuxt's brand new `nuxt-ts` package ships built-in TypeScript tooling support :
> - Nuxt official type declarations
> - Autocompletion in IDE
> - Write everything in TypeScript fashion (`layouts`, `pages`, `components`, `plugins`, `store`)
> - Runtime TS support (`nuxt.config.ts`, `modules`, `serverMiddlewares`)
> - TSX Support
