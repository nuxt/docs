<div class="Alert">

It is important to know that in any Vue [instance lifecycle](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html#Lifecycle-Diagram), only `beforeCreate` and `created` hooks are called **both, from client-side and server-side**. All other hooks are called only from the client-side.

</div>

## External Packages

We may want to use external packages/modules in our application (one great example is [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)) for making HTTP request for both server and client.

First, we should install it via npm:

```bash
npm install --save axios
```

Then we can use it directly in our page components:

```html
<template>
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
</template>

<script>
import axios from 'axios'

export default {
  async asyncData ({ params }) {
    let { data } = await axios.get(`https://my-api/posts/${params.id}`)
    return { title: data.title }
  }
}
</script>
```

## Vue Plugins

If we want to use Vue plugins, like [v-tooltip](https://akryum.github.io/v-tooltip) to display tooltips in our application, we need to setup the plugin before launching the app.
First we install the plugin
```bash
npm install --save v-tooltip
```
We create the file `plugins/vue-tooltips.js`:

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import VTooltip from 'v-tooltip'

Vue.use(VTooltip)
```

Then we add the file path inside the `plugins` key of our `nuxt.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  plugins: ['@/plugins/vue-tooltip.js']
}
```

To learn more about the `plugins` configuration key, check out the [plugins api](/api/configuration-plugins).

### ES6 plugins

If the plugin is located in `node_modules` and exports an ES6 module, you may need to add it to the `transpile` build option:

```js
module.exports = {
  build: {
    transpile: ['vue-notifications']
  }
}
```
You can refer to the [configuration build](/api/configuration-build/#transpile) docs for more build options.

## Inject in $root & context

Sometimes you want to make functions or values available across the app.
You can inject those variables into Vue instances (client side), the context (server side) and even in the Vuex store.
It is a convention to prefix those functions with a `$`.

### Inject into Vue instances

Injecting context into Vue instances works similar to when doing this in standard Vue apps.

`plugins/vue-inject.js`:

```js
import Vue from 'vue'

Vue.prototype.$myInjectedFunction = string => console.log('This is an example', string)
```

`nuxt.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  plugins: ['~/plugins/vue-inject.js']
}
```

You can now use the function in all your Vue components.

`example-component.vue`:

```js
export default {
  mounted () {
    this.$myInjectedFunction('test')
  }
}
```


### Inject into context

Injecting context into Vue instances works similar to when doing this in standard Vue apps.

`plugins/ctx-inject.js`:

```js
export default ({ app }, inject) => {
  // Set the function directly on the context.app object
  app.myInjectedFunction = string => console.log('Okay, another function', string)
}
```

`nuxt.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  plugins: ['~/plugins/ctx-inject.js']
}
```

The function is now available whenever you have access to the `context` (for example in `asyncData` and `fetch`).

`ctx-example-component.vue`:

```js
export default {
  asyncData (context) {
    context.app.myInjectedFunction('ctx!')
  }
}
```

### Combined inject

If you need the function in the `context`, Vue instances and maybe even in the Vuex store, you can use the `inject` function, which is the second parameter of the plugins exported function.

Injecting content into Vue instances works similar to when doing this in standard Vue apps. The `$` will be prepended automatically to the function.

`plugins/combined-inject.js`:

```js
export default ({ app }, inject) => {
  inject('myInjectedFunction', string => console.log('That was easy!', string))
}
```

`nuxt.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  plugins: ['~/plugins/combined-inject.js']
}
```

Now the function can be used from `context`, via `this` in Vue instances and via `this` in store `actions`/`mutations`.

`ctx-example-component.vue`:

```js
export default {
  mounted () {
    this.$myInjectedFunction('works in mounted')
  },
  asyncData (context) {
    context.app.$myInjectedFunction('works with context')
  }
}
```

`store/index.js`:

```js
export const state = () => ({
  someValue: ''
})

export const mutations = {
  changeSomeValue (state, newValue) {
    this.$myInjectedFunction('accessible in mutations')
    state.someValue = newValue
  }
}

export const actions = {
  setSomeValueToWhatever ({ commit }) {
    this.$myInjectedFunction('accessible in actions')
    const newValue = 'whatever'
    commit('changeSomeValue', newValue)
  }
}

```

<div class="Alert">

Be ware, do not use Vue plugins inside exported functions. exported functions called before each request,
so calling `Vue.use(...)`, `Vue.mixin(...)`, `Vue.component(...)`, cause your app crash after too many requests.

</div>


## Client-side only

Some plugins might work **only in the browser** because they lack SSR support.
In these situations you can use the `mode`: `client` option in `plugins` to add the plugin only on the client-side.

Example:

`nuxt.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  plugins: [
    { src: '~/plugins/vue-notifications', mode: 'client' }
  ]
}
```

`plugins/vue-notifications.js`:

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueNotifications from 'vue-notifications'

Vue.use(VueNotifications)
```

In case you need to import some libraries in a plugin only on *server-side*, you can check if the `process.server` variable is set to `true`.

Also, if you need to know if you are inside a generated app (via `nuxt generate`), you can check if `process.static` is set to `true`. This is only the case during and after the generation.

You can also combine both options to hit the spot when a page is being server-rendered by `nuxt generate` before being saved (`process.static && process.server`).

**Note**: Since Nuxt.js 2.4, `mode` has been introduced as option of `plugins` to specify plugin type, possible value are: `client` or `server`. `ssr: false` will be adapted to `mode: 'client'` and deprecated in next major release.

Example:

`nuxt.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  plugins: [
    { src: '~/plugins/both-sides.js' },
    { src: '~/plugins/client-only.js', mode: 'client' },
    { src: '~/plugins/server-only.js', mode: 'server' }
  ]
}
```

### Name conventional plugin

If plugin is assumed to be run only in client or server side, `.client.js` or `.server.js` can be applied as extension of plugin file, the file will be automatically included in corresponding side.

Example:

`nuxt.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  plugins: [
    '~/plugins/foo.client.js', // only in client side
    '~/plugins/bar.server.js', // only in server side
    '~/plugins/baz.js' // both client & server
  ]
}
```
