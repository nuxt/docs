> Nuxt.js comes with a set of useful commands, both for development and production purpose.

## List of Commands

| Command         | Description                                                                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| nuxt            | Launch a development server on localhost:3000 with hot-reloading.                        |
| nuxt build      | Build your application with webpack and minify the JS & CSS (for production).            |
| nuxt start      | Start the server in production mode (after running `nuxt build`).                        |
| nuxt generate   | Build the application and generate every route as a HTML file (used for static hosting). |

#### Arguments

You can use `--help` with any command to get detailed usage. Common arguments are:

- **`--config-file` or `-c`:** specify the path to `nuxt.config.js` file.
- **`--spa` or `-s`:** Runs command in SPA mode by disabling server side rendering.

#### Using in package.json

You should put these commands in the `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nuxt",
  "build": "nuxt build",
  "start": "nuxt start",
  "generate": "nuxt generate"
}
```

Then, you can launch your commands via `npm run <command>` (example: `npm run dev`).

<p class="Alert Alert--nuxt-green"><b>Pro tip:</b> to pass arguments to npm commands, you need an extra <code>--</code> script name (example: <code>npm run dev -- --spa</code>).</p>

## Development Environment

To launch Nuxt in development mode with hot reloading:

```bash
nuxt
// OR
npm run dev
```

## Production Deployment

Nuxt.js lets you choose between three modes to deploy your application: Server Rendered, SPA or Static Generated.

### Server Rendered Deployment (Universal)

To deploy, instead of running `nuxt`, you probably want to build ahead of time. Therefore, building and starting are separate commands:

```bash
nuxt build
nuxt start
```

You can also set `server.https` in `nuxt.config.js` with the same set of options passed to [`https.createServer`](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html), should you choose to serve Nuxt in HTTPS mode. Unix sockets are also available if you set the `server.socket` option in `nuxt.config.js` (or `-n` in the [CLI](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/commands#list-of-commands)). When using [Unix sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets), make sure not to set the `host` and `port` parameters otherwise the `socket` parameter is ignored.

The `package.json` like follows is recommended:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "dependencies": {
    "nuxt": "latest"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nuxt",
    "build": "nuxt build",
    "start": "nuxt start"
  }
}
```

Note: we recommend putting `.nuxt` in `.npmignore` or `.gitignore`.

### Static Generated Deployment (Pre Rendered)

Nuxt.js gives you the ability to host your web application on any static hosting.

To generate our web application into static files:

```bash
npm run generate
```

It will create a `dist` folder with everything inside ready to be deployed on a static hosting site.

If you have a project with [dynamic routes](/guide/routing#dynamic-routes), take a look at the [generate configuration](/api/configuration-generate) to tell Nuxt.js how to generate these dynamic routes.

<div class="Alert">When generating your web application with `nuxt generate`, [the context](/api/context) given to [data()](/guide/async-data#the-data-method) and [fetch()](/guide/vuex-store#the-fetch-method) will not have `req` and `res`.</div>

### Single Page Application Deployment (SPA)

`nuxt generate` still needs SSR engine during build/generate time while having the advantage of having all our pages pre rendered, and have a high SEO and page load score. The content is generated at *build time*. For example, we can't use it for applications where content depends on user authentication or a real time API (at least for the first load).

The SPA idea is simple! When SPA mode is enabled using `mode: 'spa'` or `--spa` flag, and we run build, generation automatically starts after the build. This generation contains common meta and resource links, but not page content.

So, for an SPA deployment, you must do the following:

 - Change `mode` in `nuxt.config.js` to `spa`.
 - Run `npm run build`.
 - Deploy the created `dist/` folder to your static hosting like Surge, GitHub Pages or nginx.

Another possible deployment method is to use Nuxt as a middleware in frameworks while in `spa` mode. This helps reduce server load and uses Nuxt in projects where SSR is not possible.
