# Nuxt.js Documentation

> This is where the documentation is stored and served as an API

## Developing

:warning: You must at least use `node >= 8.0.0` (supports async/await) to start the server.

:warning: You must also have the main [nuxtjs.org](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxtjs.org) website repo up and running on localhost to be able to run the docs...

Start a dev server on `localhost:4000`:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then access the docs via the website running on `http://nuxt:3000` (see instructions on [nuxtjs.org](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxtjs.org) repo).

### Want to help with the translation?

[gl]: https://gitlocalize.com

Much of the translation was done using a tool called [GitLocalize][gl], which is unfortunately reaching its end of service soon. Hence, we're currently exploring and open to suggestions on how to keep this process as streamlined as possible.

For now, **always check the `en/` version** of a document for its latest revision before starting a translation.
