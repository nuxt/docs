# Nuxt.js Documentation

> This is where the documentation is stored and served as an API

## Developing

:warning: You must at least use `node >= 8.0.0` (supports async/await) to start the server.

:warning: You must also have the main [nuxtjs.org](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxtjs.org) website repo up and running on localhost to be able to run the docs...

Start a dev server on `localhost:4000`

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then access the docs via the website running on `http://nuxt:3000` (see instructions on [nuxtjs.org](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxtjs.org) repo).

### Want to help with the translation?

If you feel okay with translating sorta alone, just fork the repo, create a "work-in-progress" pull request (mark it with [WIP], see [Russian translation](https://github.com/nuxt/docs/pull/3) if you need an example) — and just go on.

If you are more of a team player, maybe Translation Gang is for you? Then just let us know somehow that you're ready to join this international open-source translators community. Feel free to contact [Grigoriy Beziuk](https://gbezyuk.github.io) or anybody else from the team.

And thank you in advance ;)
