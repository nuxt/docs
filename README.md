# Nuxt.js Documentation

Our new docs are in beta and have now moved to the [Nuxtjs.org repo](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxtjs.org) where you will find then under the [content/](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxtjs.org/tree/master/content) folder as the new docs are now using the content module. Please see the [ReadMe](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxtjs.org/blob/master/README.md) of that repo for more info on how to contribute.
