# Nuxt.js Documentation

> This is where the documentation is stored and served as an API

## Developing

:warning: You must at least use `node >= 8.0.0` (supports async/await) to start the server.

:warning: You must also have the main [nuxtjs.org](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxtjs.org) website repo up and running on localhost to be able to run the docs...

Start a dev server on `localhost:4000`:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then access the docs via the website running on `http://nuxt:3000` (see instructions on [nuxtjs.org](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxtjs.org) repo).
